                    <h1> NRCan floods Docker - Winter 2021 </h1>
                    <p> In order to facilitate the development, the deployment of the code on any environment and the possibility to perform several processes in parallel, I developed a Docker image capable of executing automatic image processing in an isolated container. This image integrates various image processing scripts, several open-source libraries such as ESA SNAP as well as code allowing to download data from AWS and NRCan EODMS API (see image on the right). </p>
                    <p> For more details, you can visit <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/egssgu/sar-flood" target="_blank">DockerHub</a>. </p>

                    <h1> Geographic Information System - Summer 2020 </h1>
                    <p> NRCan uses satellite imagery to actively monitor spring flooding and ice breakup to produce near real-time maps to support emergency response activities in Canada. The development of algorithms, techniques and software for data processing is an important task. I have worked on processing Rasters using GDAL to produce polygons representing open water flooding and flooded vegetation. I developed Python scripts to apply automated algorithms related to remote sensing systems and to ensure their quality and reliability through unit tests.  </p>

                    <p> During a team project in the course of introduction to software engineering, I developed an android application for managing appointments in clinics. I worked on the back-end in Java and on managing a database in real time using Firebase.  </p>

                    <p> Following my course in linear algebra, I developed a small program in Python capable of doing various operations on matrices. This allowed me to work on 2D arrays while practicing mathematical basics such as scaling a matrix and calculating its determinant. </p>

                    <p> During my job at VIVA Lab, I worked on various extraction and processing techniques on a large quantity of images with Python. I had to make image comparisons using colors with OpenCV or PIL as well as graphical representations on data in Json file with matplotlib.  </p>
                    <p> For more details, you can view an example of the code. <a href="color_identification.py" target="_blank"> Here</a>, it is the part that compare images of cyclists.
