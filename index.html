                <p>Hi! My name is Simon Paquette and I am currently at the University of Ottawa in Computer Science. I am impressed with what programming brings to our daily lives in all areas of employment. What attracts me to computer science is to overcome challenges and create to advance medical and engineering technologies. I am also passionate about science, which led me to pursue a minor in biophysics. In addition, I like playing soccer, I have been devoted since I was five years old. I also enjoy running, I participated to the Défi Pierre Lavoie in high school, a relay race between Quebec City and Montreal. </p>
                <p> I am hardworking and persistent, which allows me to adapt to the challenges that programming brings. Indeed, when a project presents itself and I have to learn a new algorithm, I do the necessary research to apply it effectively. I like the work to be done well and I take the time to understand what needs to be done to complete a project. With my experience working in the restaurant field, I have learned to work effectively in a team. I like that we can interact with peers to achieve a result together. </p>
                <p> I invite you to visualize my resume and some small projects I have done in programming.</p>
